1.In line 35, 37, 42, and 47 you repeated yourself multiple times and violates the
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle in software engineering as it makes your code
longer than it needs to be. You can imporve this by creating a dictonary and map the
values to the a function or a string and call function or print the string.
2.On line 13 and 23 you used ceil(random) and it can be improved through the Keep it simple
stupid (KISS) principle which makes the code more complicated than it needs to be which
can cause errors. As you can improve this by replacing it with the function randint()
, which you can also remove the 'from math import ceil' line.
3.Throughout the code there are no comments that explains the code, which makes it
difficult for other people to understand and document what this code does without 
any explanation (Opacity). You can fix the problem by adding comments after every line.
4.Throughout the code you didnt implement any function to make the code shorter,
which violates the top-down thinking and doesnt abstract the code to simpler case,
making it harder to edit and reuse. You can fix this by implementing functions
thoughtout the code such as breaking the rolling of dice into one function, rerolling()
into another function and printing result into another function.
5.There are no exception and error handling within line 21 to 26 as well as throughout 
the code, for example if the player input an invalid input eg. 8, 9 or a, there
would be an error but there are no exception or error handling that would happen in
the code which crashes the code. To fix this you need to raise an exception when an 
invalid input is put in or a number outside the range to handle the error.
